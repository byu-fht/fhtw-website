* When Henry Silverstein Got Cold: Using Technology to Reconstruct a Case of
  Census Fraud (Tammy Hepps, Treelines.com)

  When Henry Silverstein Got Cold: Using Technology to Reconstruct a Case of
  Census Fraud On January 2, 1920, Henry Silverstein began his first day as a
  census enumerator by turning left instead of right, and things went downhill
  from there. At the time, he successfully concealed from his supervisors that
  he resorted to an illegal scheme to finish the job. This talk will review how
  technology ranging from record matching to GIS mapping uncovered the true
  extent of Henry's deception a century later. While this kind of fraud is rare,
  this investigation points to ways that technology can help genealogical
  researchers become better critics of the sources they rely upon.

  (This talk will be a behind-the-scenes look at the research that went into
  this essay.)

* Crawling dusty narratives (Kimball Clark, Kindex)

  Nearly seven years after its release, Kindex.org debuts a clever path for
  users to opt in to publishing private historical narratives, without
  compromising user privacy. Learn how Kindex does this with the meld of machine
  learning, crawlers, and crowd-sourced transcription.

- Machine Learning for the Restoration of Historical Images (Nathan Byers, BYU)

  For our capstone project we are working to harness the power of machine
  learning for the restoration of historical images. We believe making this
  machine learning technology more accessible to all people will help build
  deeper connections with their ancestors. We would like to integrate our
  application with FamilySearch to allow users to restore images stored on
  FamilySearch. We would also like to get our product in front of more people,
  in order to help us test our product and get user feedback. To accomplish
  this, we would love to give a demo of our application to several individuals
  at the Family History Technology Workshop.
