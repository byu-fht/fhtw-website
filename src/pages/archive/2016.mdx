Amy Harris, Brigham Young University

_A Genealogist's Technological Wish List: Teaching, Filtering, and Mapping_

<img class="sidebar" src="/conf/2016/amy-harris.jpg" />

Amy Harris is an associate professor of history at BYU and an accredited
genealogist. Her research interests focus on families, women, and gender in
early modern Britain. She is particularly interested in the way family and
social relationships inform one another. Her first book, Siblinghood and Social
Relations in Georgian England: Share and Share Alike (2012) used both historical
and genealogical methods to explore sibling relationships and their connections
to political and social ideas of equality. Her most recent publication, Family
Life in England and America, 1690-1820, a four-volume, co-edited collection of
transcribed and annotated primary sources, was published in August 2015. All of
her work combines historical and genealogical methodologies. Prof. Harris
teaches European history, beginner and advanced genealogy courses, and women's
studies. She currently serves as the director of the Family History Program at
BYU.
