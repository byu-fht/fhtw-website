## Parking

We have reserved 20 free parking spots in the lot to the east of the Hinckley
Center. These will be marked off with orange cones. If these spots are full,
then additional free visitor parking is available further east on North Campus
Drive, past the guard shack.

Do not park in spots marked **Hinckley Visitor**, because these are reserved for
temporary visits to tour the center.

As a guest of BYU, and to help you enjoy your stay, please remember that
disability stalls, dean and official stalls, service stalls, red curbs, and
other specially reserved spaces, require specific permits. Parking in any of
these stalls without the proper permit will result in a parking citation. please
remember that timed stalls are enforced for the time posted.
